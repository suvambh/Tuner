### ðŸ”¬ Code Breakdown

#### `windowed = data * np.hanning(len(data))`

* This applies a **Hann window** to your audio signal.
* Why? It smooths the edges of the signal so the FFT doesn't produce **spectral leakage** (false peaks caused by sharp cutoffs).
* `np.hanning(...)` returns an array of the same length as `data`, shaped like a bell curve that tapers to zero at the edges.

âœ… **Effect:** Reduces noise and improves accuracy of the FFT.

#### `mag = np.abs(np.fft.rfft(windowed))`

* This performs a **real-valued Fast Fourier Transform**:

  * `np.fft.rfft(...)` gives you the **frequency spectrum** from 0 Hz up to the Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate).
  * The result is complex numbers (real + imaginary parts).
* `np.abs(...)` takes the magnitude (length) of each complex number â†’ this represents the **power (or intensity)** of each frequency.

âœ… **Effect:** Now you have an array `mag` that tells you **how strong each frequency is**.

---

#### `freqs = np.fft.rfftfreq(len(windowed), d=1/sr)`

* This creates an array of **frequency values** (in Hz) that line up with each value in `mag`.
* `len(windowed)` â†’ how many samples you're transforming
* `d=1/sr` â†’ the spacing between samples (inverse of sample rate)

âœ… **Effect:** Now you know that `mag[i]` corresponds to the frequency `freqs[i]`
